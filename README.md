# jasql - JSON document storage in SQL for node.js

## ![jasql](resources/logo-200px.png) node.js + JSON + SQL = bliss

jasql is a node.js storage library for storing schemaless documents in various relational databases.

jasql is built on knex, and supports sqlite3, ~~postgre~~, ~~mysql~~, ~~oracle~~, and ~~mssql~~.

_support for the missing databases above is coming soon!_

jasql's API is heavily inspired by pouchdb and is intuitive and designed to be rapidly used in applications exporting REST APIs.

# Roadmap

* implement missing db drivers
* add search functionality
* investigate improved indexing
